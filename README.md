## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to create a program that will allow users to create customizable Venn diagrams. We wanted to give our clients the ability to add any text they want, change the colour scheme of the entire diagram and be able to download and edit their work as they please. Our goal is to create a product that allows our clients to unleash their creative side and change the way that information is presented. 


## What Does It Do So Far?

The program allows the user to: 
* Add a title to the diagram
* Add a title to each circle in the diagram
* Add text and images
* Drag and drop text and images into the circles
* Change the colours of the circles, text and the background
* Add descriptions to images and text
* Clear the Venn diagram to start over
* Delete selected text or image
* Export Venn diagram as an answer key (.vansr)
* Import an answer key 
* Check if Venn diagram is correct by clicking the "Check Answer" button
* Save Venn diagram as a .venn file so that it can be reopened in the future and edited again
* Save Venn diagram as an image
* Import Venn diagram as a CSV file
* Export Venn diagram as a CSV file
