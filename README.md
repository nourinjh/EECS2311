# Digital Venn Diagram Tool

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to create a program that will allow users to create customizable Venn diagrams. We wanted to give our clients the ability to add any text they want, change the colour scheme of the entire diagram and be able to download and edit their work as they please. Our goal is to create a product that allows our clients to unleash their creative side and change the way that information is presented.
